            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a cross-platform,
                object oriented scipting language.
                There is a key in the locked box at home to my car.
                In it is a licence with a new name, SSN,
                and 10 thousand dollars. Your uncule is in
                mexico waiting for you in Caborc. Get there NOW
                as soon as you can. LEAVE NOW, its too late for so
                save yourself and RUN! Run as fast and for as long as
                you can till you are safe in Uncle Vinny's arms GO!
                It also lives inside a host environment 
                (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected 
                to the objects of these environments.

                <li><a href="">Variable Decleration</a> JavaScript variables are containser for storing data values
                imagine a cup holds coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique
                names. These unique names are called identifiers <span class="quote">var x;</span></li>
                <li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - 
                    our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to
                    hold. The = assignment operator assignsa value to a variable. <span class="quote">var x = 10;</span></li>
                <li><a href="">DataType</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to
                     know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives:
                     Booleans- <span class="quote">true</span> or <span class="quote">false;</span> null 
                     <span class="quote">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="quote">42</span> or 
                     <span class="quote">3,14159;</span> String - <span class="quote">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
                     array - <span class="quote">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object <span class="quote">{first_name:'Jane', 
                         last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
                <li><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to be able to 
                    preform different actions for different decisions- hitting different code 
                    blocks based on values or conditional statments: <span class="quote">if</span> a specified 
                    condition is true, dothis code in our code block; <span class="quote">else if</span> to specify a new 
                    condition to test, id the first condition is false; <span class="quote">else</span> we execute this 
                    block of code;</li>
                <li><a href="">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, 
                    but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.
                    Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
                    Thats a stop!</li>
                <li><a href="">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulatopn of a code block. 
                    When we call our function this will run that code block. 
                    Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting 
                    together a deck from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, 
                    first we scew the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way 
                    . Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tales to do so
                     lets call our function over and over and over agian.</li>
